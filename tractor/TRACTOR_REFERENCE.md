## NPM Scripts

```bash
# Root
npm run dev          # concurrently runs server + client
npm run dev:server   # server only (tsx watch)
npm run dev:client   # client only (vite)
npm run build        # builds shared → server → client

# Client: dev, build, preview
# Server: dev, build, start
# Shared: build, watch
```

---

## App Flow / Routing

No router library — state-driven rendering in `App.tsx`:

```
Connecting spinner (ws not connected)
  → LobbyScreen (no roomId)
    → RoomLobby (roomId, no gameState)
      → GameTable (gameState exists)
        → Phases: Drawing → KittyPickup → KittyExchange → FriendDeclaration → ReadyToPlay → Playing → Scoring
          → Next Round (loops back to Drawing)
          → GameOver
```

Back navigation: Leave button → clears session, reloads page.

---

## Styling / Theme

**CSS Variables** (in `client/src/styles/global.css`):

| Variable        | Value       | Usage                  |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| `--bg-dark`     | `#1a1a2e`   | Page background        |

| `--card-bg`     | `#faf8f0`   | Card face background   |

**Responsive scaling:** `--scale: clamp(0.7, ..., 1.3)`, `--card-w: clamp(56px, 5vw, 90px)`

**Layout:** CSS Grid for table, Flexbox for components, absolute positioning for seat arrangement.

## REST Endpoints

| Method | Path         | Description           |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------|
| GET    | `/api/rooms` | List all active rooms |

---

## Game Modes

1. **Tractor (Fixed Teams)** — 2 or 4 player teams, defending vs attacking
2. **Finding Friends** — Landlord calls friend cards, teams revealed during play

---

## Game Settings (30+ options in SettingsPanel)

Key settings: number of players (2–6), number of decks, joker inclusion, bid policy, landlord selection, kitty theft policy, card protection, throw evaluation, friend selection restrictions, advancement policy, bomb policy, max rank (Ace or No-Trump).

---

## Card Rendering (Card.tsx)

- Number cards: 10-pip system (2–10)
- Face cards: Unicode chess symbols (♞ ♕ ♔)
- Jokers: Star symbols
- Suits: Unicode ♠ ♥ ♦ ♣
- Visual effects: selected glow, trump highlight, point card indicator

---

## State Management

- **Client:** `useGame` hook holds all state (playerId, roomId, gameState, roomInfo, roomList). Session persisted in localStorage with 2hr expiry.
- **Server:** `RoomManager` (map of rooms), `Room` (players + game + settings + chat), `Game` (authoritative game state + phase logic).
- No external state library (Redux, Zustand, etc.) — just React hooks.

---

## Key Technical Details

- Server is authoritative for all game logic
- Cards sorted/ordered via `card.ts` utilities
- Tractor detection in `tractor.ts` (consecutive pairs/triples of same suit)
- Play validation in `trick.ts` (must follow suit, match format)
- Scoring in `scoring.ts` (5s=5pts, 10s/Kings=10pts)
- Disconnect/reconnect handled via `rejoin_room` message
- Sound: procedural tones via Web Audio API (no audio files)
- No static images — all card graphics rendered in React/CSS
